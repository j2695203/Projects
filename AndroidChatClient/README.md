# Background
This is one of my course project (CS6011 Fall 2022) in Master of Software Development in University of Utah.

I developed a *client-server* model with *WebSocket* infrastructure using *Java* to send messages in a private room, and implemented web page and Android interface for multiple users using *JavaScript* and *HTML*.


# Install
Git clone to your local repository. 
```
git clone https://github.com/j2695203/Projects.git
```

# Usage
1. After cloning the repository, go to `MyHttpServer/` to turn on the Http Server first.
2. Choose a way to start chatting:
  * Web browser: turn on the web browser and go to ```localhost:8080/WebChat.html```
  * Androind App: go back to repository `AndroidChatClient/`and use Android Studio to execute this project
