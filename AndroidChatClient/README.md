# Background
This is one of my small group project developed in 4 days during my course in Master of Software Development in University of Utah.
It was built with _C++_ with _SFML_ library.

# Install
Git clone to your local repository. 
```
git clone https://github.com/j2695203/Projects.git
```

# Start the Game
After cloning the repository, go to `Dinosaur/build/` to start the game by:
```
$ ./testSFML
```

Jump to avoid the rolling meteorites, and spit three salivas to eliminate a coming fireball, or you will die!
The speed gets faster as time passes. Enjoy it!
